# Langchain-Chatbot

## Overview
This project contains a simple chatbot built using Langchain library and tested via connecting to Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 model from OpenAI running locally at LM studio. Future modifications are planned for this project in order to gain practival NLP knowledge.

## Already Implemented
- Start version of chatbot

## Planned
- Adding memory and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## Files
- `app.py`: Main file with application code.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains list of python dependencies required to run application.

## Usage
To interact with chatbot, follow these steps:
1. Install LM studio and run a recent model like Mistral 7B locally.
2. Set up required parameters in main file.
3. Run `app.py` file to initialize chatbot and interact with running model.

## Example Usage

System: Send a message to start chat!

User: Hi, tell me please some ideas for python project related to NLP so I can learn this topic and also practice ?

Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1: Hello! There are many interesting Python projects related to NLP that you could work on. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1. Sentiment analysis: Write a program to analyze the sentiment of a given text, such as whether it is positive, negative or neutral. You can use pre-built datasets, like the IMDb movie reviews dataset, or build your own by collecting data from the web.
2. Text classification: Write a program to classify text into different categories based on its content. For example, you could create a program that classifies news articles as either "politics" or "sports".
3. Named entity recognition: Write a program to identify named entities in text, such as people, organizations, and locations.
4. Machine translation: Write a program to translate text from one language to another using machine learning algorithms.
5. Text summarization: Write a program to automatically generate a summary of a given text.
6. Chatbot development: Build a chatbot that can understand natural language and respond appropriately. You can use libraries like spaCy or NLTK to process the user's input and generate a response.
7. Text-to-speech conversion: Write a program to convert written text into spoken words using machine learning algorithms.

These are just a few ideas, but there are many other projects you could work on depending on your interests. I hope these ideas help you get started with NLP in Python!
